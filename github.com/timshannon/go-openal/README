OpenAL bindings for Go.
====================================

I've forked this library from https://github.com/phf/go-openal 
and have started changing it quite a bit from the original library.

I don't have any experience with the original OpenAl libraries, so
I'm going to be rearranging this a bit to fit my needs.  


To install simply install the openal and alc libs appropriately for
your platform, or build them from scratch, then run

go get -u github.com/timshannon/go-openal/


*Note, as of commit 0a4cd0b this library is no longer compatible with Go 1.3.3 and older.*
